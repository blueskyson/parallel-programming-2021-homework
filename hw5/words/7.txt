Please answer the following questions:
If we try to parallelize the for i loop (the outer loop), which variables should be private and which should be shared?
If we parallelize the for i loop using the scoping you speciÔ¨Åed in the previous part,are there any loop-carried dependences? Explain your answer.
Can we parallelize the call to memcpy? Can we modify the code so that this part of the function will be parallelizable?
Write a C program that includes a parallel implementation of Count sort.
How does the performance of your parallelization of Count sort compare to serial Count sort? How does it compare to the serial qsort library function?
